How can you start and stop services is dependent upon what initialization daemon is used by your Linux server: SysVinit, Upstart, or Systemd. Before you do any service management, be sure to use the examples to help you determine your Linux server's initialization daemon.

The concepts of starting and stopping services go along with other service management concepts, such as making a service persistent, starting certain services at server boot time, reloading a service, and restarting a service. Undersetting these concepts is very helpful as you learn about configuring and managing a Linux print server.
